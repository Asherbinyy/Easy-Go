## Features

The package provides a wide range of features to enhance your app's navigation, such as:

- Support for custom page transitions and animations
- Provides an easy way to set transitions for each platform (iOS, Android, Web, etc.)
- Built-in animations such as slide, fade, and scale
- Support for named routes and automatic route generation
- The ability to pass data between pages
- Easy to debug and test


A simple and easy-to-use API that can be integrated seamlessly into your existing app

## Getting started

Add the package to your pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  easy_go: latest_version
```
import the package in your dart file:
``` dart
import 'package:easy_go/easy_go.dart';
```
run the following command in your project's root directory to init the package:
```bash
dart go_init.dart --name=NamedRoutes
```
This will create a file named named_routes.dart in your project's root directory.
This file will contain all the named routes in your app.
You can add more routes to this file manually.


## Setup the Package

1.Pass the navigator key (Go.navigatorKey) to the MaterialApp widget
```dart
MaterialApp(
  navigatorKey: Go.navigatorKey,
  home: const HomePage(),
),
```
2. To use named routes, you need to make sure that named_routes.dart is imported in your dart file.
3. Create a Router Generator class that extends GoGenerator giving your customizations for each route.
 ex :
```dart
class RouterGenerator extends GoGenerator {
  @override
  Route<dynamic> goRoutes(RouteSettings settings) {
    final namedRoute = routerName(settings); /// You must include that line
    switch (namedRoute) {
      case NamedRoutes.home:
        return GoBuilder().build(
          const HomePage(),
          settings: settings,
          transition: TransitionType.fade,
        );
      case NamedRoutes.secondPage:
        return GoBuilder().build(
          const SecondPage(),
          settings: settings,
          transition: TransitionType.fade,
        );
      case NamedRoutes.thirdPage:
        return GoBuilder().build(const ThirdPage(), settings: settings);
      case NamedRoutes.fourthPage:
        return GoBuilder().build(const FourthPage(), settings: settings);
    }
  }

  @override
  Route<dynamic> undefineRoute() {
    return MaterialPageRoute(
      builder: (_) => const Scaffold(
        body: Center(
          child: Text('No route exists here ! '),
        ),
      ),
    );
  }
}

```
4. Pass the Router Generator class to MaterialApp's onGenerateRoute parameter.
```dart
MaterialApp(
  navigatorKey: Go.navigatorKey,
  onGenerateRoute: RouterGenerator().goRoutes,
  home: const HomePage(),
),
```


# Usage
Once you finished setting up the package, you can use it in your app by calling the Go class methods.

* For Simple navigation between pages
```dart
TextButton(
  onPressed: () {
    /// This will create a fade transition between the current page and the next page
     Go.to(const SecondPage(), transition:  TransitionType.fade,options:FadeAnimationOptions());
  },
  child: Text('Go to page 2'),
),
```
* For passing data between pages with named routes

```dart
TextButton(
  onPressed: () {
    /// This will create a fade transition between the current page and the next page
    Go.toNamed(NamedRoutes.first, arguments: 'Hello World');
  },
  child: Text('Go to second'),
),
```
to get the data in the second page, you can use the following code:
```dart
class SecondPage extends StatelessWidget {
  const SecondPage({Key? key}) : super(key: key);

  @override
  Widget build(BuildContext context) {
    final data = context.arguments ;
    return Scaffold(
      body: Center(
        child: Text(data), /// This will display 'Hello World'
      ),
    );
  }
}
```
# Platform Specific Transitions

By default Go provides a suitable transition for each platform ios , android and web.

To use a custom transition for a specific platform, you can use the GoBuilder class before running the app

ex :
```dart
void main() {
  GoBuilder().initAppRouter(
    config: PlatformConfig(
      android: CustomPageRouterCreator(
        parentTransition: TransitionType.slide,
        parentOptions: const SlideAnimationOptions(
          direction: SlideDirection.topToBottom,
        ),
      ),
       /// ios: Add IOS Animation Options
      /// web: Add Web Animation Options
    ),
  );
  runApp(MyApp());
}
```
This will create a slide transition for android and the default transition for ios (Cupertino Transition) and web.


## Parameters

## Options Parameters

- **duration**: The duration of the transition
